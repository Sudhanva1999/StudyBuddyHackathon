## Lecture Notes: Deconstructing a Software Engineer Cover Letter

This lecture analyzes a cover letter written by Akshay Chavan, a Senior Software Engineer, applying for a position at Bloomberg. We'll dissect the letter's structure, content, and strategic choices to understand effective cover letter writing for technical roles.  This analysis will also provide practical advice applicable to your own cover letter writing process.

### I. Introduction: The Purpose of a Cover Letter

*   A cover letter is a targeted document accompanying your resume, providing context and highlighting relevant skills and experiences.  Think of it as your personalized introduction to the hiring manager.
*   It's your chance to make a strong first impression and persuade the hiring manager to delve deeper into your application. Your resume provides the *what* (your qualifications), while your cover letter provides the *why* (why you are the right fit).
*   Unlike a resume, which lists your qualifications chronologically, a cover letter allows you to narrate your career story, weaving a compelling narrative that connects your experiences directly to the job requirements.
