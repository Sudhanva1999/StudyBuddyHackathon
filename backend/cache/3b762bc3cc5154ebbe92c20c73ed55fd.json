Artificial intelligence is the intelligence exhibited by \nmachines or software. It is the subfield of computer science. Artificial \nintelligence is becoming a popular field in computer science as it has \nenhanced the human life in many areas. Artificial intelligence in the last two \ndecades has greatly improved performance of the manufacturing, service \nsector and so in the field of educa tion. Study in the field of artificial \nintelligence has given rise to the rapidly growing technology known as expert \nsystem. Application areas of artificial intelligence is heaving a huge impact \non various fields of life as expert system is widely used in these days to solve \nthe complex problems in various areas as education, engineering, business, \nmedicine, weather forecasting etc. The areas employing the technology of \nartificial intelligence have seen an increase in the quality and efficiency. This \npaper gives an overview of this technology and the scope of artificial \nintelligence in different areas with special reference to the use of this \ntechnology in the field of education along with its meaning, searching \ntechniques, inventions and future.   \n                    \nINTRODUCTION  \n \nIt is claimed that artificial intelligence is playing an increasing role in the research of educational technology, \nmanagement sciences and operational research areas. Intelligence is commonly considered as the ability to \ncollect knowledge to solve complex problems. In the near future intelligent machines will replace human \ncapabilities in many areas. Artificial intelligence is the study of intelligent machines and software that can \nreason, learn, gather knowledge, communic ate, manipulate and perceive the objects. John McCarthy coined \nthe term in 1956 as branch of computer science concerned with making computers behave like humans. It is \nthe study of the computation that makes it possible to perceive reason and act. Artifici al intelligence is different \nfrom Psychology because it emphasis on computation and is different from computer science because of its \nemphasis on perception, reasoning and action. It makes machines smarter and more useful. It works with the \nhelp of artific ial neurons (artificial neural network) and scientific theorems (if then statements and logics). AI \n\nJournal of Advanced Zoology   \n \nAvailable online at: https://jazindia.com                                                                                                                       230  technologies have matured to the point in offering real practical benefits in many of their applications. Major \nartificial intelligence areas are Expert sys tems, Intelligent computer aided instructions, Natural language \nprocessing, Speech understanding, Robotics and sensory systems, Computer vision and scene recognition, \nNeural computing. From these expert system is a rapidly growing technology which is heavi ng a huge impact \non various field of life. The various techniques applied in artificial intelligence are Neural network, Fuzzy \nlogic, Evolutionary computing, Computer aided instructions and Hybrid artificial intelligence.  \nIt is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It \nis related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to \nconfine itself to methods that are biologically observable. While no co nsensual definition of Artificial \nIntelligence (AI) exists, AI is broadly characterized as the study of computations that allow for perception, \nreason and action. Today, the amount of data that is generated, by both humans and machines, far outpaces \nhumans \u2019 ability to absorb, interpret, and make complex decisions based on that data. Artificial intelligence \nforms the basis for all computer learning and is the future of all complex decision making. This paper examines \nfeatures of artificial Intelligence, intr oduction, definitions of AI, history, applications, growth and \nachievements.  \n \nEvolution of AI definition  \nAI has a history much longer than is commonly understood, in fields from science and philosophy ranging all \nthe way back to ancient Greece but its mode rn iteration owes much to Alan Turing and conference in Dartmouth \nCollege in 1956 where the term \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d was officially coined and defined by John McCarthy \nat the time as \u201cthe science and engineering of making intelligent machines\u201d.  Russel and Norvig (2020)  referred \nto it as the \u201cthe birth of artificial intelligence.\u201d One of the initial paradigms of AI was that it revolved around \nhigh-level c ognition. Not the ability to recognise concepts, perceive objects, or execute complex motor skills \nshared by most animals, but the potential to engage in multi -step reasoning, to understand the meaning of \nnatural language, to design innovative artefacts, t o generate novel plans that achieve goals, and even to reason \nabout their own reasoning. This general human like intelligence was referred to as strong AI For strong AI, the \nprimary approach has centred on symbolic reasoning, that computers are not simply numeric calculators but \nrather general symbol manipulators. As noted by  Newell and Simon (1976)  in their physical symbol system \nhypothesis, intelligent behavi our appears to require the ability to interpret and manipulate symbolic structures. \nWhile this approach showed promise initially ( Newell & Simon, 1963 ), many branches of AI have retreated \nfrom this approach due its difficulty and the lack of progress coming in to the 21st century. It remains yet \nuncertain on when and if strong AI will be made a reality.  \nThe distinction between weak AI and strong AI is also conc erned with rule adherence, i.e., the way machines \ninteract with rules  distinguishes rule -based decision making in which machines strictly respect the rules set by \ndevelopers from rule following decision making which machines follow rules that have not bee n strictly \nspecified to them. Rule -based decision -making matches weak AI, while rule -following decision making is an \nattempt that tends towards strong AI. An example of rule -following decision making is  neural networks  (NN), \nwhich allow algorithms to learn from themselves. Strong AI would be machines making their own rules and \nthen follow them, which is not possible at the stage of right now  \nAI has gone through many peak s and troughs since its early inception in the 1950s, usually referred to as AI \n\u201csummers and winters. Since 2010, however, AI can be said to have once again entered a summer period, \nmainly due to considerable improvements in the computing power of computer s and the access to massive \namounts of data .This resurgence in AI research is the result of three breakthroughs: (1) the introduction of a \nmuch more sophisticated class of algorithms; (2) the arrival on the market of low -cost graphics processors \ncapable o f performing large amounts of calculations in a few milliseconds; and (3) the availability of very \nlarge, correctly annotated databases allowing for more sophisticated learning of intelligent systems ( Jain et al., \n2004 , Khashman, 2009 , PWC, 2019 ). \nDespite the length of time the field has existed, there is still no commonly accepted definition ( Allen, \n1998 , Bhatnagar et al., 2018 , Brachman, 2006 , Hearst and Hirsh, 2000 , Nilsson, 2009 ). This is not considered \na problem yet, as m any scientific concepts only get true definitions after they have matured enough, rather than \nat their conception, and given the complexity and breadth of AI, it may not be feasible to expect AI to have a \nset definition yet. Still, this doesn\u2019t mean that t he topic should be ignored, especially with the recent \nadvancements and advancements relating to the field.However, without a clear definition of the term, \u201c it is \ndifficult for policymakers to assess what AI systems will be able to do in the near future, a nd how the field may \nget there. There is no common framework to determine which kinds of AI systems are even desirable \u201d \n(Bhatnagar et al., 2018 ). A similar co ncern has been echoed by  Monett and Lewis (2018) , that \u201c theories of \nJournal of Advanced Zoology   \n \nAvailable online at: https://jazindia.com                                                                                                                       231  intelligence and the goal of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) have been the source of much c onfusion both within \nthe field and among the general public \u201d. \nIn the years immediately preceding and after the 1956 Dartmouth conference where the term was coined, when \nthe concept for AI was first brewing in academic consciousness, many researchers (would  later become famous \nfor their contributions to AI) formulated many theories and proposals that focused on the common features of \nmind and ( McCulloch and Pitt s, 1943 , Turing, 1950 , von Neumann, 1958 , Wiener, 1948 ). While these thought \nleaders were influential, the field of AI as we know it owes more to McCarthy, Minsky, Newell, and Simon. \nWhile this is partly due to thei r own attendance of the famous 1951 Dartmouth conference, it is likely more \nsince they went on to establish three leading research centres which shaped the stream of though regarding AI \nfor years. Their own opinion on AI was as follows; \u201cBy \u2018general intelli gent action\u2019 we wish to indicate the \nsame scope of intelligence as we see in human action: that in any real situation behaviour appropriate to the \nends of the system and adaptive to the demands of the environment can occur, within some limits of speed and \ncomplexity\u201d (Newell & Simon, Computer science as empirical enquiry: Symbols and search, 1976).  \nIntelligence usually means \u201c the ability to solve hard problems \u201d (Minsky, 1958 ). \n\u201cAI is concerned with methods of achieving goals in situations in which the information available has a certain \ncomplex character. The methods that have to be used are related to the problem presented by the situation and \nare similar whether the problem solver is human, a Martian, or a computer program\u201d  (McCarthy, 1988 ). With \nthe variety of separate opinions on what AI is, lacking agreemen t on a standard evaluation (i.e., criteria, \nbenchmark tests, milestones) makes it extremely challenging for the field to maintain healthy growth \n(Hern\u00b4andez -Orallo, 2017 ). \n \nA systematic guide to literature review development  \nOkoli (2015)  propose a systematic review process that consists of 8 steps, namely planning (2 steps), selection \n(2 steps), extraction (2 steps) and execution (2 steps) that are completed across 4 phases (see  Fig. 1 .). Each of \nthese four phases and  eight steps are discussed in detail in the remainder of the section.  \n \n \n \nDiscussion  \n \nThis section summarises the findings of the SLR and highlights some areas that research to date has focused \nand the key findings from these studies. It is then followed b y a discussion on the theoretical contributions and \nimplications for practice. The overall goal is to uncover themes that are relevant for research and practice and \nidentify areas which warrant further research. This section will discuss relevant insights we found from the \nliterature, starting with the lack of cohesion around the definition of AI, the resurgence of AI interest and \nresearch in recent years, the specific contribution types of AI literature, and the disproportionate focus on \nmachine learning a nd process automation . \n\nJournal of Advanced Zoology   \n \nAvailable online at: https://jazindia.com                                                                                                                       232  In this study we conducted a SLR that provides a comprehensive overview on AI in IS related studies. By using \na systematic literature review, we identified, classified, and analysed 1877 studies on AI and ML in IS that \nwere published between 2005 and 2020. Of these, 98 were identified as primary studies, after a rigorous \nfiltering process. To understand the fundamentals of AI in IS we examined a nd studied the articles based on \nstudies by year, publication channel, research methods used, and their contribution to IS contributions research. \nPrior to commencing this task however, we had to consider the problem that the definitions of artificial \nintelligence were largely varied and ambiguous.  \n \nFollowing are the sample Questions?  \n1) Are you aware of Artificial intelligence?  \n2) Should AI be allowed to replace human workers in certain job?  \n3) Do you agree that artificial intelligence has useful applicati ons in the medical field and education      sector?  \n4) How will the advancements of artificial intelligence and robotics impact your decision of being     involved \nin a specialty?  \n5) Do you believe that artificial intelligence will significantly impact the  future of technology and society?\"  \n6) Artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize healthcare and improve patient outcomes?  \n7) Ethical considerations aside, I am comfortable with the use of AI -powered virtual assistants in my daily life?  \n 8) I believe that governments should establish clear regulations for the ethical use of AI technology?  \n9) I believe that AI should be used to address global challenges such as climate change, poverty, and healthcare \ndisparities?  \n10) AI has the potential to enhance efficiency and productivity in various industries?  \n \nDATA ANALYSIS:  \n \n \n \n \n\nJournal of Advanced Zoology   \n \nAvailable online at: https://jazindia.com                                                                                                                       233   \n \n \n\nJournal of Advanced Zoology   \n \nAvailable online at: https://jazindia.com                                                                                                                       234   \n \n \n\nJournal of Advanced Zoology   \n \nAvailable online at: https://jazindia.com                                                                                                                       235   \n \nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE METHODS:  \n \n1. Machine Learning  \nIt is one of the applications of AI where machines are not explicitly programmed to perform certain tasks; \nrather, they learn and improve from experience automatically. Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning \nbased on artificial neural networks for predictive analysis. There are various machine learning algorithms, such \nas Unsupervised Learning, Supervise d Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. In Unsupervised Learning, the \nalgorithm does not use classified information to act on it without any guidance. In Supervised Learning, it \ndeduces a function from the training data, which consists of a set of an input  object and the desired output. \nReinforcement learning is used by machines to take suitable actions to increase the reward to find the best \npossibility which should be taken in to account.  \n \n2. Natural Language Processing(NLP)  \nIt is the interactions between c omputers and human language where the computers are programmed to process \nnatural languages. Machine Learning is a reliable technology for Natural Language Processing to obtain \nmeaning from human languages. In NLP, the audio of a human talk is captured by the machine. Then the audio \nto text conversation occurs, and then the text is processed where the data is converted into audio. Then the \nmachine uses the audio to respond to humans. Applications of Natural Language Processing can be found in \nIVR (Interacti ve Voice Response) applications used in call centres, language translation applications like \nGoogle Translate and word processors such as Microsoft Word to check the accuracy of grammar in text. \nHowever, the nature of human languages makes the Natural Lang uage Processing difficult because of the rules \nwhich are involved in the passing of information using natural language, and they are not easy for the computers \nto understand. So NLP uses algorithms to recognize and abstract the rules of the natural languag es where the \nunstructured data from the human languages can be converted to a format that is understood by the computer.  \n \nAutomation & Robotics  \nThe purpose of Automation is to get the monotonous and repetitive tasks done by machines which also improve \nproductivity and in receiving cost -effective and more efficient results. Many organizations use machine \nlearning, neural networks, and graphs in automation. Such automation can prevent fraud issues while financial \ntransactions online by using CAPTCHA technol ogy. Robotic process automation is programmed to perform \nhigh volume repetitive tasks which can adapt to the change in different circumstances.  \n \n3. Machine Vision   \nMachines can capture visual information and then analyze it. Here cameras are used to capture the visual \ninformation, the analogue to digital conversion is used to convert the image to digital data, and digital signal \nprocessing is employed to process the data. Then the resulting data is fed to a computer. In machine vision, \ntwo vital aspects are s ensitivity, which is the ability of the machine to perceive impulses that are weak and \nresolution, the range to which the machine can distinguish the objects. The usage of machine vision can be \nfound in signature identification, pattern recognition, and me dical image analysis, etc.  \n \n\nJournal of Advanced Zoology   \n \nAvailable online at: https://jazindia.com                                                                                                                       236  4. Knowledge -Based Systems(KBS):  \nA KBS can be defined as a computer system capable of giving advice in a particular domain, utilizing \nknowledge provided by a human expert. A distinguishing feature of KBS lies in the separation beh ind the \nknowledge, which can be represented in a number of ways such as rules, frames, or cases, and the inference \nengine or algorithm which uses the knowledge base to arrive at a conclusion.  \n \n5. Neural Networks:  \nNNs are biologically inspired systems consis ting of a massively connected network of computational \n\u201cneurons,\u201d organized in layers. By adjusting the weights of the network, NNs can be \u201ctrained\u201d to approximate \nvirtually any nonlinear function to a required degree of accuracy. NNs typically are provide d with a set of input \nand output exemplars. A learning algorithm (such as back propagation) would then be used to adjust the weights \nin the network so that the network would give the desired output, in a type of learning commonly called \nsupervised learning . \n \nApplications of AI  \n \n \n1. AI in Astronomy  \nArtificial Intelligence can be very useful to solve complex universe problems. AI technology can be helpful \nfor understanding the universe such as how it works, origin, etc.  \n2. AI in Healthcare  \n In the last, five to ten years, AI becoming more advantageous for the healthcare industry and going to have a \nsignificant impact on this industry. o Healthcare Industries are applying AI to make a better and faster diagnosis \nthan humans. AI can help docto rs with diagnoses and can inform when patients are worsening so that medical \nhelp can reach to the patient before hospitalization.  \n3. AI in Gaming  \nAI can be used for gaming purpose. The AI machines can play strategic games like chess, where the machine \nneed s to think of a large number of possible places.  \n4. AI in Finance  \nAI and finance industries are the best matches for each other. The finance industry is implementing automation, \nChabot, adaptive intelligence, algorithm trading, and machine learning into financial processes.  \n5. AI in Data Security  \nThe security of data is c rucial for every company and cyber -attacks are growing very rapidly in the digital \nworld. AI can be used to make your data more safe and secure. Some examples such as AEG bot, AI2 Platform, \nare used to determine software bug and cyber -attacks in a better w ay.  \n6. AI in Social Media  \nSocial Media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Snap chat contain billions of user profiles, which need to be \nstored and managed in a very efficient way. AI can organize and manage massive amounts of data. AI can \nanalyse lots of data to identify the latest trends, hashtag, and requirement of different users.  \n6. AI in Travel & Transport  \n\nJournal of Advanced Zoology   \n \nAvailable online at: https://jazindia.com                                                                                                                       237  AI is becoming highly demanding for travel industries. AI is capable of doing various travel related works such \nas from making travel arrangement to suggesting the hotels, flights, and best routes to the customers. Travel \nindustries are using AI -powered ch atbots which can make human -like interaction with customers for better and \nfast response.  \n7. AI in Automotive Industry  \nSome Automotive industries are using AI to provide virtual assistant to their user for better performance. Such \nas Tesla has introduced Te slaBot, an intelligent virtual assistant. o Various Industries are currently working for \ndeveloping self -driven cars which can make your journey more safe and secure.  \n8. AI in Robotics:  \nArtificial Intelligence has a remarkable role in Robotics. Usually, gen eral robots are programmed such that \nthey can perform some repetitive task, but with the help of AI, we can create intelligent robots which can \nperform tasks with their own experiences without pre -programmed. o Humanoid Robots are best examples for \nAI in r obotics, recently the intelligent Humanoid robot named as Erica and Sophia has been developed which \ncan talk and behave like humans.  \n9. AI in Agriculture  \nAgriculture is an area which requires various resources, labor, money, and time for best result. Now a day's \nagriculture is becoming digital, and AI is emerging in this field. Agriculture is applying AI as agriculture \nrobotics, solid and crop monitoring, predictive analysis. AI in agriculture can be very helpful for farmers.  \n10. AI in E -commerce  \n AI is provid ing a competitive edge to the e -commerce industry, and it is becoming more demanding in the e -\ncommerce business. AI is helping shoppers to discover associated products with recommended size, color, or \neven brand.  \n11. AI in education:  \nAI can automate grading so that the tutor can have more time to teach. AI chatbot can communicate with \nstudents as a teaching assistant. o AI in the future can be work as a personal virtual tutor for students, which \nwill be accessible easily at any time and any place.  \n \nSOME OTHER  APPLICATIONS : \n \n1. Fraud detection.   \nThe financial services industry uses artificial intelligence in two ways. Initial scoring of applications for credit \nuses AI to understand creditworthiness. More advanced AI engines are employed to monitor and detect \nfraudulent payment card transactions in  real time.  \n2. Virtual customer assistance (VCA).   \nCall centres use VCA to predict and respond to customer inquiries outside of human interaction. Voice \nrecognition, coupled with simulated human dialog, is the first point of interaction in a customer service  inquiry. \nHigher -level inquiries are redirected to a human.  \n3. Medicine : \n A medical clinic can use AI systems to organize bed schedules, make a staff rotation, and provide medical \ninformation. AI has also application in fields of cardiology (CRG), neurology (MRI), embryology \n(solography), complex operations of internal organs etc.  \n4. Heavy Industries  :  \nHuge machines involve risk in their manual maintenance and working. So in becomes necessary part to have \nan efficient and safe operation agent in their operatio n. \n5. Telecommunications :  \nMany telecommunications companies make use of heuristic search in the management of their workforces for \nexample BT Group has deployed heuristic search in a scheduling application that provides the work schedules \nof 20000 engineer s.  \n6. Music :  \nScientists are trying to make the computer emulate the activities of the skillful musician. Composition, \nperformance, music theory, sound processing are some of the major areas on which research in Music and \nArtificial Intelligence are focusing  on. Eg:chucks, Orchextra, smartmusic etc.  \n7. Antivirus : \n Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have played increasingly important role in antivirus detection. At \npresent, some principal artificial intelligence techniques applied in antivirus detection It improves the \nperformance of antivirus detection systems , and promotes the production of new artificial intelligence \nalgorithm and the application in antivirus detection to integrate antivirus detection with artificial intelligence.  \nJournal of Advanced Zoology   \n \nAvailable online at: https://jazindia.com                                                                                                                       238  Conclusion  \n \nThis systematic literature review study provides a structured unde rstanding of the state -of-the-art of AI research \nin IS. This was achieved by identifying 98 primary studies out of 1877 related AI articles over a fifteen -year \nperiod (2005 \u2013 2020) and analysed them with respect to (i) definitions of AI, (ii) frequency of publication by \nyear, (iii) publication channels, (iv) research method and data collection type, (v) contribution type, (vi) type \nof AI and (vii) business value.  \nA clear finding emerging from this systematic literature review is the need to (i) increase the  number of rigorous \nacademic studies on AI, especially regarding tools and models, (ii) be more detailed on the definition of AI \nused in studies, even when it is not the focus, and (iii) build on cumulative knowledge. Research on AI in IS is \nstill largely unexplored. While there is a relatively sizable amount of literature concerning AI in some way, a \ncomprehensive review of what is known about AI in IS is lacking. This is especially true for the way AI is \ndefined in IS, which is still disparate. This study  examines the body of knowledge about AI in IS. This work \nhas developed one of the very few SLRs on AI in IS and has provided a structured analysis of trends and gaps \nin the field. The study provides new insights to the field of IS through the utilisation of conceptions of AI \ndefinition, mapping activities to AI, and value relating to AI. We identified gaps in knowledge in the context \nof AI research and IS, which provides a starting point for IS researchers and IS practitioners to advance the \nsocio -technica l knowledge surrounding AI. Thus, we make a call for future IS studies to examine AI, \nspecifically to how AI is defined in contemporary IS research.  \n \nReferences:  \n \n1. http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Computer_Science:Artificial_Intelligence http://www.howstuffworks.com/ \narificialintelligence  \n2. http:// www.google.co.in   \n3. http://www.lib rary.thinkquest.org   \n4. https://www.javatpoint.com/application -of-ai \n5. https://www.educba.com/artificial -intelligence -techniques/  \n6. https://www.cigionline.orgw/articles/cybersecuritybattlefield/?utm _source=google_ads&utm_medium=\ngrant&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsdz9qLSF_AIVzQ0rCh1bNQylEAA YAiAAEgI40_D_BwE  \n \n", "confidence": 1.0}, "summary": "# Artificial Intelligence and Its Applications\n\n**Lecture Notes**\n\n## I.
